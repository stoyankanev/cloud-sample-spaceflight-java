# Exercise 02: Understand the data model and deploy app to SAP Cloud Platform

## Estimated time

25 minutes

## Objective

In this exercise you will have a look into the data model of the application and you will deploy it to your SAP Cloud Platform account.

## Exercise description

### 1. Build the data model and deploy it to SAP HANA

1.1. Click on the folder `db` of your project and from the context menu select `Build` > `Build`.

   <p align="center"><img width="480" src="res/pic101.png" alt="Build the database"> </p>

   > During this step, the data model is compiled into the respective `hdbcds` artifacts, which are then deployed to an HDI Container (a database schema).  In Web IDE's console view you can watch the progress of the deployment operation.

1.2. While the deployment is running, take a look into the data model.  Open the `db` folder, double-click on the file `flight-model.cds`.  Read through the comments and make yourself familiar with the `Bookings` entity, as this is the one the exercises deal with.

   > Tip: To help you find files easier in the tree, enable the `Link Workspace to Editor` setting.  Everytime you switch to another editor, this will select the file in the file tree.

1.3. Once the HANA artifacts are created, you should see a success message in the console view at the bottom.

1.4. Let's take a look into what was deployed. Right-click again on the `db` folder and select `Open HDI container`.  This will open up the SAP HANA database explorer.

   In case you are asked whether to add any database, simply click `No`, as the database connection will be added automatically.

1.5. Click on the `Tables` icon on the left, select table `TECHED_FLIGHT_TRIP_BOOKINGS`, which opens the table editor.

   <p align="center"><img width="860" src="res/pic110.png" alt="See table definition"> </p>

1.6. If you want to see the table data, click on the `Open Data` button on the top right.

   <p align="center"><img width="480" src="res/pic111.png" alt="Click on Open Data button"> </p>
   <p align="center"><img width="860" src="res/pic112.png" alt="Data view"> </p>

   > The data you see here is maintained in the resource folder `db > src > csv` and was deployed along with the table definitions.
       <p align="center"><img width="860" src="res/pic113.png" alt="CSV files in db folder"> </p>


### 2. Run the OData service

2.1. Go back to the `Development` perspective of your workspace and select the `srv` folder of your project.  Click on the green **Run** icon in the main toolbar to run the app.

   <p align="center"><img width="480" src="res/pic201.png" alt="Press Run"> </p>

2.2. In the console you can watch how the service is being build any deployed. Once it is ready, a link is provided. Click on that link to the OData endpoints in the browser.

   <p align="center"><img width="860" src="res/pic202.png" alt="Application being deployed"> </p>

2.3. The OData endpoints are displayed. Click on the link for the `BookingService`.

   <p align="center"><img width="480" src="res/pic203.png" alt="API endpoints"> </p>

2.4. You can now see the entities of the booking service...

   <p align="center"><img width="640" src="res/pic204.png" alt="Bookingservice entities"> </p>

   ... and all bookings, by navigating to the `BookingService/Bookings` URL.
   <p align="center"><img width="640" src="res/pic205.png" alt="Bookings entities"> </p>

So far the database and the service layer are running. In the next step we will deploy the UI.

### 3. Run the UI module

3.1. Click on the `app` folder of your project. Click again on the **Run** icon in the main toolbar.

   <p align="center"><img width="480" src="res/pic301.png" alt="Press Run"> </p>


3.2. On the first run, a dialog may be shown asking you to log on to the Neo environment.  Again provide the email address and the password for your user.

   <p align="center"><img width="480" src="res/pic303.png" alt="Log on to create destination"> </p>

   > This double login will become superfluous in future versions of Web IDE.

3.3. Once the app is created, a browser window will be opened.  There, click on the first tile named `app`.

   <p align="center"><img width="480" src="res/pic304.png" alt="Select the tile named 'app'"> </p>

3.4. In the `Bookings` screen, click on the `Go` button to fetch the bookings from the database.

   <p align="center"><img width="640" src="res/pic305.png" alt="Fetch bookings through the 'Go' button"> </p>

3.5. You can get to the details for each booking, by clicking on one of them.
   <p align="center"><img width="640" src="res/pic306.png" alt="Inspect single booking"> </p>

   Compare the fields on the screen with the `Bookings` entity from `db/flight-model.cds`.  Note how `Itineraries.Name` is shown here in the field `Trip`, instead of its `ID`.


## Next

Great!  We have the initial version of the app up and running, and are now prepared to enhance it.
